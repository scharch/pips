igblast (v1.3.0)
installation:
- can download stand-alone igblast from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/1.3.0/
- follow installation instructions

support databases for igblast:
- the IMGT database does not come installed with igblast. Excerpt from igblast readme:

"To search IMGT germline sequences, you need to download them from IMGT web site 
(http://www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/share/textes/ ).   After you have downloaded the sequences, 
invoke our utility tool edit_imgt_file.pl (download from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/ directory) to process the sequences (to change the long IMGT definition lines to germline gene names only).  For example:

./edit_imgt_file.pl imgt_file > my_seq_file

Then you can use NCBI's makeblastdb tool to make the blast database from the output file.  For example:

makeblastdb -parse_seqids -dbtype nucl -in my_seq_file

Now you can use my_seq_file as blast database file for igblast."

- we can distribute pre-processed imgt database (and UNSWIg) files with package (current as of June 2014)
- some strange bug regarding auxiliary data, which doesn't seem to be used, 
	but script won't run without the option

assemble_contigs
- version of spades.py is 3.5.0 downloaded from http://spades.bioinf.spbau.ru/release3.5.0/
